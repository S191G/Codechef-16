## ðŸ“‚ Topics Covered

### 1. Reverse a String
**What it does:** Reverses the characters of a given string.  
**Why it matters:** Common string manipulation and loop/logic test.

---

### 2. Palindrome Check
**What it does:** Checks whether a given string or number is a palindrome.  
**Why it matters:** Tests understanding of control structures and string reversal.

---

### 3. Extract Last Digit of a Number
**What it does:** Uses modulo operation to isolate the last digit.  
**Why it matters:** Useful for number-based logic, often in digit-based problems.

---

### 4. Second Largest Element in Array
**What it does:** Finds the second largest unique number in an array.  
**Why it matters:** Checks loop handling, conditional logic, and edge cases.

---

### 5. Character Frequency Count
**What it does:** Counts how often each character appears in a string.  
**Why it matters:** Reinforces understanding of `HashMap` and iteration.

---

### 6. Iterating and Printing Map Entries
**What it does:** Uses `Map.Entry` to loop through key-value pairs.  
**Why it matters:** Common task in Java when working with collections.

---

### 7. Remove Whitespaces from String
**What it does:** Removes all whitespaces using regex.  
**Why it matters:** Regex is essential in string preprocessing and cleanup.

---

### 8. Fibonacci (Using Recursion)
**What it does:** Calculates the nth Fibonacci number recursively.  
**Why it matters:** Demonstrates recursive thinking and function calls.

---

### 9. Finding Duplicates in an Array
**What it does:** Identifies duplicate elements using sets.  
**Why it matters:** Solid test of data structures and algorithmic reasoning.

---

### 10. Balanced Parentheses
**What it does:** Validates matching pairs of brackets using a stack.  
**Why it matters:** Classic stack-based problem used in parsing and compilers.
